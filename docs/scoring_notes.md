# Scoring Notes

The scoring algorithm is a weighted calculation based on several factors:

*   **Exposure Time:** Longer exposures get more points.
*   **Recency:** More recent observations are valued higher.
*   **Instrument:** Newer, more advanced instruments (like WFC3) get a significant boost.
*   **Filters:** Certain scientific filters are prioritized.

## Rule of 42

As a fun feature, any observation whose score rounds to exactly 42 is given a special "Don't Panic" badge in the UI. This is a nod to Douglas Adams' *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*.
